## **Game Modes**

CS2 features various game modes, which can be played on your server. To make setting up your server a bit easier, the following table sums up the configuration required in your server's [LinuxGSM config](../configuration/linuxgsm-config.md) for the various game modes. If you want more detailed and up-to-date information, take a look at Valve's wiki: [CS2 Game Modes](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/CS:GO\_Game\_Modes).

When adjusting the `mapgroup`, don't forget to also set `defaultmap` to a map contained in the same mapgroup.

If players are respawning in random locations on custom maps, set `mp_randomspawn` to 0.

If players are being banned for dying too much, such as on minigames maps, as a workaround set `mp_autokick` to 0. **Warning, this disables AFK and Teamkilling kicks as well.**

## Workshop

it is possible to add a single or collection of workshop maps to a Counter-Strike 2 server.

### Workshop ID

First, gather the map or collection ID. To do this find the workshop map or collection you want to use on the [CS2 steam workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/app/730/workshop/) and look at the URL; it will contain the required ID number. In the example below the ID is `3075706807`.

```
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3075706807
```

### Create a Collection



### Auth Key

If you are using a collection you will need to get an auth key from [here](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey).
